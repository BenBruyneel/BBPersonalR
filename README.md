# BBPersonalR

R Package with a number of R functions that I developed to be able to work quickly on eg graphs, databases, etc etc

Install with the command:

devtools::install_github("BenBruyneel/BBPersonalR")

Note: functions and their workings may change at any time.

Also: I am aware that the package depends on a lot of other non-default packages. As this package is primarily for personal use, I do not consider this a problem!

As always: work in progress!!
